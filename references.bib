	isbn = {978-1-5416-7570-4},
	shorttitle = {The art of statistics},
	abstract = {Shows how to apply statistical reasoning to real-world problems. This isn't simply memorizing formulas or using the tools in a spreadsheet; Spiegelhalter emphasizes the importance of clarifying questions, assumptions, and expectations, and-- more importantly-- knowing how to responsibly interpret the results the software generates. "Statistics are everywhere, as integral to science as they are to business, and in the popular media hundreds of times a day. In this age of big data, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw evidence-- and even more so if we hope to participate in the future, rather than being simple bystanders. In The Art of Statistics, world-renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows readers how to derive knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. The Art of Statistics not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve these problems-- it teaches us how we too can think like statisticians. We learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when approaching a problem, and-- perhaps even more importantly-- we learn how to responsibly interpret the answers we receive. Combining the incomparable insight of an expert with the playful enthusiasm of an aficionado, The Art of Statistics is the definitive guide to stats that every modern person needs."-- Provided by publisher.},

	abstract = {Statistical methods are a key part of data science, yet few data scientists have formal statistical training. Courses and books on basic statistics rarely cover the topic from a data science perspective. The second edition of this practical guide-now including examples in Python as well as R-explains how to apply various statistical methods to data science, tells you how to avoid their misuse, and gives you advice on what's important and what's not. Many data scientists use statistical methods but lack a deeper statistical perspective. If you're familiar with the R or Python programming languages, and have had some exposure to statistics but want to learn more, this quick reference bridges the gap in an accessible, readable format. With this updated edition, you'll dive into: Exploratory data analysis Data and sampling distributions Statistical experiments and significance testing Regression and prediction Classification Statistical machine learning Unsupervised learning.--},
